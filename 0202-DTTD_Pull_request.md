# Notes for making Pull Requests

Use some of your time to remind yourself how to issue a pull request and do the following:

1. Fork the repository 
2. Clone your fork using ssh
3. Make and checkout a branch 
4. Make and commit your changes (making sure to reference the issue you are fixing)
5. Push your changes to your fork and use the web interface to make a pull request

Note, although you can make changes using the GitLAB website it is highly recommended that you use this time to practice/learn how to make proper pull requests using the command line.  If you don't know how find yourself a video or tutorial. 

### Other notes 
- Doing 60 pull requests at the same time is hard. Please do your best to only edit files that you need.
- Do ***NOT*** git add all of the files in your directory. There is a good chance that hidden files will be include and your pull request will be rejected.
- You ***MUST*** include the issue number in the pull request description (ex #223)  so it gets automatically resolved.
- Make sure you actually commit things to the branch and push the branch for the pull request.
- Make meaningful branch names.  Your user name is not that helpful.

# Getting Credit for this assignment

Each member of the team should submit at least one different pull request.  Try to coordinate so that pull requests do not conflict with each other. The DTTD management team will review and merge the pull requests. 

NOTE: Again, I realize we are using a lot of jargon. This is normal when you start a new job. Please research anything you don't understand and talk with your team. Come to your instructor with questions if you can't figure out something together.
