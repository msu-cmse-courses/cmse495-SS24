# Announcements and Professional Skills Presentation

We will spend a few minutes doing team "shout outs" and the instructors will give a short presentation about professional skills not covered in the CyberAmbassador Curriculum.

# Group one-on-one presentations

The instructors will go around to each team and spend up to 20 minutes discussing your projects.  Please have an agenda ready with a short demo of what is currently working and use the time to discuss questions and challenges you have with the instructor.  

When the instructor is not meeting with your group, use this time to work on your projects. 

Note: the instructors will not have enough time to visit all groups so we will be doing this multiple weeks in a row.  Order will be determined by the instructors based on this weeks 3x3.
