As a team you need to prepare for two final presentations.  The first will be your final video and the second will be an in-person presentation at the symposium.  This assignment you will present a plan for both.  There are two deliverables for this assignment:

1. Storyboard for your final video
2. Basic script for your final presentation.

# 1. Storyboarding

At this point in the semester I will assume that you know how to build a storyboard. Make one for your final presentation.  This is your big moment so make it look good. 

# 2. Presentation Plan

Your final presentation will be in the form of a in-person poster session.  You will be expected to stand in front of a display and talk about your project. These types of presentations are tricky as they will require you to be flexible.  

It is important that you give everyone on your team a role and maybe even switch it up a bit.  Maybe have someone be the "main" presenter, someone else run the demo, a third person would be in charge of ansering questions, etc. 

Key to a good interactive presentation is to get people to ask questions.  This means you must be willing to stop a presentation or start over.  

Please type up a plan (and practice) your presentations. This can just be a simple text document you email me. Some things to include:

- A short script or summary of what you plan to say.
- A list of roles for the team.
- What will your team wear?
- What questions do you anticipate and how will you answer them?

# Submission

Include a copy of the storyboard in your teams drive as a PowerPoint file. Give it a reasonable name so the instructor does not need to hunt for it. 

Send your plan as an email to the instructor with a link to the storyboard. The title of the email should be "**_GROUP_NAME-CMSE495_Final_Presentation_Plan_**".


---
# Evaluation
These storyboard slides will be graded on good effort attempt to follow directions and complete the project. Instructors will give feedback on the slides so that students can integrate changes before the presentation date.

---

# Post Evaluation

Review the feedback from your classmates and slides. Add additional information to your storyboard and finish making the video.
