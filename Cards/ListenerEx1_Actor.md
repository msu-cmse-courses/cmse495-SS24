# Actor (Speaker) – Slow Code

- You are a graduate student. You have a program written in Python that runs way too slow on your personal computer. You took the introduction to HPC course, learned to write a submission script, and ran the same program on the HPC.  It took you almost two weeks to make this transition from your personal machine to the HPC, and you are frustrated because – despite all your effort – the code does not run any faster on the HPC.
- To start the conversation say the following to the CI-Facilitator “**I put my code on the HPC and it is not running any faster.**”
- Provide additional details when asked – the more complicated, the better! Where you are comfortable, add lots of discipline jargon or made-up words to add confusion to your explanation. For example; “my program is calculating the zarcadian quotient for a large dataset. - This calculation is complex and takes many iterations to solve.”
- Act frustrated if you feel they are not listening.
- **Your problem is solved if the speaker can explain why your serial code doesn’t run any faster on the HPC and why you need to either rewrite the code or run it in parallel to run faster.**
