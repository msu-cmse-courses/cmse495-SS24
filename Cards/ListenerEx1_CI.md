# CI Professional (Listener) – Slow Code

- A graduate student has stopped by your office hours with a problem. You remember this student from the introduction to HPC course, which covered using Linux, compiling code and submitting a job.  
- **Listen to the student and see if you can help them identify the root cause of the problem they share.**
- Remember to use reflective listening, paraphrasing, and clarifying questions when appropriate.
