# Actor (Speaker) – GPUs are the BEST!

- You are a Post Doc trying analyze some data.  Your PI told you that GPUs are the solution, so you’re going to the HPC to ask for resources to learn how to use GPUs.
- You’re an inexperienced programmer and don’t know anything about GPUs, or about parallel programming in general.  The code you have written is in MATLAB and is slow because it’s poorly written.  A good code review with an experienced programmer will likely speed up your code 100 fold (more than enough for your needs). The only reason you are asking about GPUs is that you’ve been told they are the answer to make your code run faster.
- **Say the following to start the conversation, “My bioinformatics analysis is running too slow. I have talked the problem over with PI and I need to figure out how to run my code on GPUs.  Where is the best place to learn about GPU programming?”**
- Agree and accept any technical answer the speaker gives to you.
- If asked clarifying questions, try directing the listener to a solution that involves reviewing/fixing your code first, before you go off and learn about GPUs.
