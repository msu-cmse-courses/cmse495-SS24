# Coach – GPUs are the BEST!
As the coach your job is to listen to both the speaker and listener to see if they use the techniques:

- Reflective Listening
- Paraphrasing
- Asking Clarifying Questions

If things get stuck, suggest that the listener use one of the techniques.  

Keep notes of when techniques are used (or not!) and whether they are effective.  Your goal at the end is to give feedback to both the speaker and listener about what went well and what could be improved.
