Title: Listening Examples
Date: 2018-08-06

It’s time to practice the “Listener” role, using the tools you’ve learned

- Reflective / Active Listening
- Paraphrasing
- Asking Clarifying Questions

----

You will be split up into groups of three, and rotate through three roles:

- The **CI-Professional’s** role is as the listener in the scenario, who has the goal of understanding the problem using the listener tools
- The **Actor’s** role is to communicate the problem, following the guidelines you’re given in the scenario – have fun acting and trying to make the listener use the various tools appropriately before you “give in” and the scenario ends
- The **Coach’s** role is to observe the interactions between the listener (CI-Professional) and speaker (Actor) and provide feedback to both participants; coaches are free to “pause” the scenario and offer advice to keep things on track

# Logistics

- Break out into groups of 3 (if necessary, groups of 4 can have 2 coaches)
- Pick roles for the first example (CI-Professional, Actor and Coach)
- Read YOUR ROLE (**don’t cheat and look at the other links – that spoils the fun!**)
    1. Go to: https://tinyurl.com/ACIpractice
    2. Choose the First Breakout link, then the first example, then your role
- Do the rehearsal exercises
    1. The Actor (speaker) starts the scenario, and the CI-Professional (listener) responds
    2. The Coach provides advice as needed, and offers feedback at the end
    3. Afterwards, rotate roles and try the next scenario
    4. There are three (3) practice scenarios, which should take 5-8 minutes each

Come back here for a large group discussion at the end of the breakout sessions
