# CI Professional (Speaker) – Hardware Refresh

- You have a distinguished professor running on a older system that needs to be retired.  The system requires a ton of system administrator time to keep running, uses old and out of date software and takes up space/power/resources needed for newer systems in the data center. Unfortunately, what you know of the professor’s code is that there is a justifiable concern that the new operating system, compiler and support libraries will introduce bugs that may be non-trivial to fix.
- **You set up a meeting with the professor to explain the problem. Explain the situation to the professor about why the older systems must be retired, and get the professor to agree to move their research to the new hardware.**
- Remember to avoid jargon, use analogies when appropriate and check for understanding.
