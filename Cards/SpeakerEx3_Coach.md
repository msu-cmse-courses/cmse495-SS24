# Coach – Bad News
As the coach your job is to listen to both the speaker and listener to see if they use the techniques:

- Reducing Jargon
- Using good analogies
- Checking for understanding

If things get stuck, suggest that the speaker use one of the techniques.  

Keep notes of when techniques are used (or not!) and whether they are effective.  Your goal at the end is to give feedback to both the speaker and listener about what went well and what could be improved. Specifically, make note any jargon that is used and point it out with your feedback.
