Title: Speaking Examples
Date: 2018-08-06

It’s time to practice the “Speaker” role, using the tools you’ve learned

- Reducing Jargon
- Using Good Analogies
- Checking for Understanding

---

You will be split up into groups of three, and rotate through three roles:

- The **CI-Professional’s** role is as the speaker in the scenario, who has the goal of communicating the problem (described in the scenario) using the speaker tools
- The **Actor’s** role is to listen and respond to the speaker, following the guidelines you’re given in the scenario – have fun acting and trying to make the speaker use the various tools appropriately before you “give in” and the scenario ends
- The **Coach’s** role is to observe the interactions between the speaker (CI-Professional) and listener (Actor) and provide feedback to both participants; coaches are free to “pause” the scenario and offer advice to keep things on track

# Logistics

- Break out into groups of 3 (if necessary, groups of 4 can have 2 coaches)
- Pick roles for the first example (CI-Professional, Actor and Coach)
- Read YOUR ROLE (**don’t cheat and look at the other links – that spoils the fun!**)
    1. Go to: https://tinyurl.com/ACIpractice
    2. Choose the First Breakout link, then the first example, then your role
- Do the rehearsal exercises
    1. The CI-Professional (speaker) starts the scenario, and the Actor responds
    2. The Coach provides advice as needed, and offers feedback at the end
    3. Afterwards, rotate roles and try the next scenario
    4. There are three (3) practice scenarios, which should take 5-8 minutes each

Come back here for a large group discussion at the end of the breakout sessions
