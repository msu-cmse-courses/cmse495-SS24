# Syllabus: CMSE 495- Data Science Capstone

## Course Description
The data science capstone course is intended to provide students with an opportunity to put together what they have learned across multiple courses to develop a final project that demonstrates their ability to work in a team on real-world problems.

The capstone course has three major goals:

1. Provide students with a high impact, end-to-end project experience where they can apply classroom experiences and data science skills to solve real-world problems. 
2. Provide students with opportunities to learn and practice professional skills (communication, teamwork and leadership) in the context of team-based projects.
3. Provide opportunities for students and faculty in the department to build relationships and network with industry partners, community organizations, and campus colleagues. 




## Course Format and Activities

The class will meet three times a week during the 15-week semester. This course will be delivered **_synchronous in-person_** with no planned online classroom interaction.  This means that students are expected to attend class during the designated class period (MWF 2:40-4:00pm). Classroom time will be divided across three broad activity categories:

- Project planning, team meetings, milestones and reports (Mondays)
- Professional skills training and practice (Wednesdays)
- Software development and technical skills practice (Fridays)

Early in the semester, students will be divided into capstone teams of 4-5 people and assigned a semester long project with multiple milestones.  The majority of a students grade will come from working constructively as a team to accomplish the project goals (as defined by the instructor and the project sponsors). When possible, the majority of out-of-class time will be dedicated to tasks and deliverables that relate directly to the capstone teams’ projects.  Students should expect to spend an average of 10-15 hours a week outside of class working on their capstone projects.  



### Class participation

Class sessions will be held three times a week and broken up into presentations, discussions, group work and programming activities. 

Active class participation (led both by the instructors and by students) is critical to the success of this course.  As such, you are expected to attend every class session, bring the required materials and actively participate in the in-class discussions and activities. 

**_Students that have a justifiable need to miss class must notify via email, the instructor, the graduate teaching assistant and their project team prior to the start of class (exception to this rule is only provided for extreme cases)._**

There is a **_LOT_** of material to cover this semester. To help provide some structure the course will try to following a typical schedule. 

### Project Milestones (Typically Due Sunday by Midnight)

Although teams are encouraged to complete things early, project milestones will typically be due every **_Sunday at midnight_**.  In-class activities on most Mondays will involve reviewing project milestones, providing peer feedback and in-class time to prepare for next milestones. Details about the Milestones can be found on the course [Schedule Page](Schedule).

Starting with the second week, all project milestones will be turned in using the team's "Git repository" stored on the MSU Gitlab page.  All reports should use "git friendly formats" (aka ASCII) such as Jupyter notebooks, html and Markdown.  Instructors will automatically download changes to the repositories after the due date and check for contributions by all of the students.  Feedback will be provided using "git issues" or via a pull/merge request. **_Students are responsible for knowing how to properly use "Git" and everyone on the team is expected to make and commit changes to the repository._**

**_DO NOT WAIT_** until the weekend before something is due.  Teams are encouraged to turn things in early.  You should make a plan with your team and stick to it.  The instructor will give you plenty of information and notice so you can work ahead. NO extensions will be given and you will still need to make up all of the work. 

### Team Meetings (Typically on Mondays)

Teams are expected to conduct multiple formal team meetings each week to work on the projects.  Although some time will be provided during class to conduct meetings, students must work together to arrange regular meetings outside of class. Meeting agendas and notes are required for all meetings and should include the following:

- Meeting time, location and duration
- Attendance
- Meeting roles (facilitator, note taker and timekeeper) - These roles should change for each meeting.
- Agenda items including; planned/actual time devoted to the item and the person responsible for leading the discussion about the item during the meeting. 
- List of decisions made and tasks accomplished during the meeting.
- List of action items including; what needs to be done, who is responsible for the item and when this task will be complete. 

Meeting notes should be kept up to date, clearly organized and easily accessible by the instructors (and possible project sponsors) so that they may check in at any time to evaluate progress and provide feedback for the team.  

### Peer Evaluations (Also Typically due on Mondays)
Student grades will be partially determine by how well you work as a team.  Teamwork can sometimes be difficult but it is required when joining our modern workforce.  Peer evaluations will be used to help the instructor evaluate team dynamics and provide support to the groups if there are some team dynamic issues that need to be resolved. 

**_NOTE_**: Team peer evaluation surveys will be conducted using [CATME](https://www.catme.org/help) online tool though the course [Desire2Learn](http://d2l.msu.edu) website.  

### Group Professional Development Activities (Typically on Wednesdays)

Students will learn professional skills training in communication, teamwork and leadership.  Curriculum for these training are provided by the NSF funded CyberAmbassador program and supported in part by Tau Beta Pi (the national engineering honor society).   During these activities students will learn topics such as conflict management, solving problems in teams, conducting an effective meeting, diversity equity and inclusion, data ethics, etc.  This curriculum is intended to be highly interactive and, whenever possible, relate directly to capstone project activities. 

Completion of the entire CyberAmbassador curriculum will result in the students earning a Professional Skills Certificate.

### Pre-class assignments (Typically due Thursday by Midnight)

Each week students may be asked to complete some independent learning before class on Friday. Typically this will include reading, watching videos and short programming assignments most of which will prepare students for the in-class "mini" projects (see below) and also provide background materials needed for some of the class milestones.  Students must complete all of the pre-class requirements and fill out the pre-class survey in order to get credit for the pre-class assignment.

Students are expected to make a good faith effort to fill out the pre-class survey. The instructor needs this feedback to gage the progress of the course and make adjustments as needed.  

### In-class programming assignments (Typically on Fridays)

On Fridays teams will work together to solve "mini" data science projects.  These projects are specifically selected to help student focus and practice their technical skills working as a team.  The content of the mini projects will be constructed in to mimic the expectations of the capstone projects and will be designed to practice specific skills needed to complete the projects. 

Most "mini" projects will be given two Fridays of in-class time to complete.  It is expected that students will be able to complete these projects during class. However, motivated teams are welcome to work on the projects outside of class as long as any students include everyone in their team in the problem solving process.

# Course Policies and Expectations

## Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) and Intellectual Property (IP) agreements

Many of the project sponsors will require students to sign an Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and in some rare cases will be asked to sign an Intellectual Property (IP) agreement.  Your instructor will work with you so that you understand your rights and you will not be required to sign either document.    If students are unwilling or unable to sign these document they will be assigned to an alternative project.

- [Standard NDA Template](./Files/CMSE495_MSU_NDA_2022_template.docx)
- [Standard IP Template](./Files/CMSE495_MSU_IP_Agreement_2022.docx)

Note: The above are examples of the standard agreements. Slight variations may be made depending on the project sponsor's needs. 

## Class attendance 

This class is heavily based on material presented and worked on during class, and it is critical that you attend and participate fully every week! Therefore, class attendance is absolutely required.  

Arriving late or leaving early without prior arrangement with the instructor of your session may be counted as an unexcused absence.  Note that if you have a legitimate reason to miss class (such as job, graduate school, or medical school interviews) you must arrange this ahead of time to be excused from class. Three or more unexcused absences will result in the reduction of your grade by one step (e.g., from 4.0 to 3.5), with additional absences reducing your grade further at the discretion of the course instructor. **_If you are unable to attend class or complete assignments due to illness or self-isolation (as per the CDC recommended guidelines), your instructor will work to provide the necessary accommodations to ensure that your performance in class is not significantly impacted._**

## Email

At times, we will send out important course information via email.  This email is sent to your MSU email address (the one that ends in “@msu.edu”).  You are responsible for all information sent to your university email and for checking this account daily. 

## Inclusive classroom behavior 

Respectful and responsible behavior is expected at all times, which includes not interrupting other students, refraining from non-course-related use of electronic devices or additional software during class sessions, and not using offensive or demeaning language in our discussions. Flagrant or repeated violations of this expectation may result in ejection from the classroom, grade-related penalties, and/or involvement of the university Ombudsperson. In particular, behaviors that could be considered discriminatory or harassing, or unwanted sexual attention, will not be tolerated and will be immediately reported to the appropriate MSU office (which may include the MSU Police Department).

In addition, MSU welcomes a full spectrum of experiences, viewpoints, and intellectual approaches because they enrich the conversation, even as they challenge us to think differently and grow. However, we believe that expressions and actions that demean individuals or groups comprise the environment for intellectual growth and undermine the social fabric on which the community is based. These demeaning behaviors are not welcome in this classroom.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

> Michigan State University is committed to providing equal opportunity for participation in all programs, services and activities. Requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities may be made by contacting the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities at 517-884-RCPD or on the web at [http://rcpd.msu.edu](http://rcpd.msu.edu).  Once your eligibility for an accommodation has been determined, you will be issued a Verified Individual Services Accommodation ("VISA") form. Please present this form to the instructor at the start of the term and/or two weeks prior to the accommodation date (test, project, etc.). Requests received after this date may not be honored.

## Academic honesty

Intellectual integrity is the foundation of the scientific enterprise.  In all instances, you must do your own work and give proper credit to all sources that you use in your papers and oral presentations – any instance of submitting another person’s work, ideas, or wording as your own counts as plagiarism.  This includes failing to cite any direct quotations in your essays, research paper, class debate, or written presentation.  The MSU College of Engineering adheres to the policies of academic honesty as specified in the General Student Regulations 1.0, Protection of Scholarship and Grades, and in the all-University statement on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades, which are included in Spartan Life: Student Handbook and Resource Guide.  Students who plagiarize will receive a 0.0 in the course.  In addition, University policy requires that any cheating offense, regardless of the magnitude of the infraction or punishment decided upon by the professor, be reported immediately to the dean of the student's college.  (See also the[ Academic Integrity](https://www.msu.edu/%7Eombud/academic-integrity/index.html) webpage.)

It is important to note that plagiarism in the context of this course includes, but is not limited to, directly copying another student’s solutions to assignments; copying materials from online sources, textbooks, or other reference materials without citing those references in your source code or documentation, or having somebody else do your in-class work or homework on your behalf.  Any work that is done in collaboration with other students should state this explicitly, and have their names as well as yours listed clearly.

More broadly, we ask that students adhere to the Spartan Code of Honor academic pledge, as written by the Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU):

**_“As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.”_**

## Limits to confidentiality

Personal assiignments and peer review information materials submitted for this class are generally considered confidential pursuant to the University's student record policies.  

However, for many assignments this course is partnering with partners outside of MSU and students should be aware that instructors will not be able to maintain confidentiality with respect to project deliverables and anything that may come up which conflicts with their responsibility to report certain issues to protect the health and safety of MSU community members and others. 

As the instructor, I must report the following information to other University offices (including the Department of Police and Public Safety) if you share it with me: suspected child abuse/neglect, even if this maltreatment happened when you were a child, allegations of sexual assault or sexual harassment when they involve MSU students, faculty, or staff, and credible threats of harm to oneself or to others. These reports may trigger contact from a campus official who will want to talk with you about the incident that you have shared.  In almost all cases, it will be your decision whether you wish to speak with that individual.  If you would like to talk about these events in a more confidential setting you are encouraged to make an appointment with the MSU Counseling Center.


## Changes to Syllabus

The syllabus may also be adjusted if needed. These types of changes will be announced during class, by email and/or in the course’s website.

## Commercialized Lecture Notes

All lectures, videos and notes provided in this course are copyrighted by the university.  Recording of lectures and/or commercialization of other university-provided course materials is not permitted in this course.

## Disruptive Behavior

Article 2.III.B.4 of the[ Student Rights and Responsibilities (SRR)](http://splife.studentlife.msu.edu/academic-freedom-for-students-at-michigan-state-university) for students at Michigan State University states: 

> "The student's behavior in the classroom shall be conducive to the teaching and learning process for all concerned." Article 2.III.B.10 of the[ SRR](http://splife.studentlife.msu.edu/academic-freedom-for-students-at-michigan-state-university) states that "The student and the faculty share the responsibility for maintaining professional relationships based on mutual trust and civility."

[ General Student Regulation 5.02](http://splife.studentlife.msu.edu/regulations/general-student-regulations) states: 

>"No student shall . . . interfere with the functions and services of the University (for example, but not limited to, classes . . .) such that the function or service is obstructed or disrupted. Students whose conduct adversely affects the learning environment in this classroom may be subject to disciplinary action through the Student Judicial Affairs office."

## Grief Absence Policy

Michigan State University is committed to ensuring that the bereavement process of a student who loses a family member during a semester does not put the student at an academic disadvantage in their classes. If you require a grief absence, you should complete the “Grief Absence Request” web form no later than one week after knowledge of the circumstance. I will work with you to make appropriate accommodations so that you are not penalized due to a verified grief absence.

## MSU Community Compact for COVID-19

During the Spring 2022 semester a set of requirements have been put in place to maximize the health and safety of all members of the MSU community. More details can be found on the [MSU Community Compact website](https://msu.edu/together-we-will/msu-community-compact/). 


### Student illness and Exposure to COVID-19

If a student is exposed to someone who is ill or has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, they will stay home, contact a health care provider and follow all public health recommendations.  There are multiple policies available to complete course work. Please talk to your instructors and [review the university policies](https://deanofstudents.msu.edu/medical-leave ). 


### Instructor illness

In the event that the instructor gets ill, the course will continue.  Backup instructors have been identified and will step in.
