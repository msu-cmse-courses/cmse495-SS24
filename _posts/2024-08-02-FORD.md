The CMSE 495 Data Science Capstone at Michigan State University offers students a chance to integrate their knowledge from various data science courses, into a final project in a practical setting. This allows the students to demonstrate their proficiency in data science by working collaboratively on significant, real-world problems. 

One such project in the Spring 2024 semester was brought forth by a community partner â€“ Ford Motor Company. Ford Motor Company is a global automotive manufacturer based in Dearborn, Michigan, known for producing cars, trucks, and commercial vehicles. It was founded by Henry Ford in 1903 and played a pivotal role in the development of assembly line production techniques and manufacturing processes. It is a leading global manufacturer of cars, trucks, and commercial vehicles to this date.  

The problem that Ford presented through their project was indeed interesting. Paint defects in the automotive industry pose significant problems because they directly impact the visual appeal and market value of vehicles, making them less attractive to potential buyers. These defects, such as scratches, dents, or uneven coatings, can lead to customer dissatisfaction that put a strain on manufacturers' reputations and financial resources. Addressing these defects requires costly rework and repairs, disrupting production lines and reducing overall efficiency.  

Identifying the factors that influence the painting process and pinpointing where and why defects occur are crucial for enhancing product quality and operational efficiency. Through analyzing vast amounts of production data can reveal patterns and correlations that lead to paint defects, enabling manufacturers to their processes to minimize errors. This not only reduces waste and saves costs but also ensures customer satisfaction by delivering vehicles of high aesthetic and durability standards. 

Through this project, the team is learning to applying data science to solve real-world problems, particularly in decision-making regarding the selection of appropriate tools and methods to address the specific challenge posed by Ford. We are getting hands-on experience in understanding the project's requirements and collaborating closely with Ford, our community partner, to ensure the solutions they develop are aligned with the company's needs. This collaborative effort is teaching us how to effectively communicate and work within a team to deliver a solid end result, choosing the right analytical tools and methods for the task. Additionally, the project is enhancing our problem-solving skills, the ability to analyze large datasets, and our understanding of how data science can influence manufacturing quality and efficiency.  

We extend our heartfelt thanks to Ford Motor Company for their invaluable partnership on this project. This opportunity has not only provided us with a practical application for our data science skills but has also deeply enriched our learning experience. Ford's support and insights have been important in helping us tackle real-world challenges, offering us a firsthand look at the challenges in the automotive and manufacturing industry. This project has played a crucial role in advancing our academic and professional growth. We are truly grateful to Ford for this remarkable opportunity to make an impact.
